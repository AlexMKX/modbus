2.3 Description of Output Type Switching
Customers can switch the current type output or voltage type output according to the site
conditions.
1. Open the configuration software and communicate with the upper computer, select 0-5V, 0-10V,
4-20mA for each output type.
2. The circuit board needs to be changed accordingly.
If you choose current type input, short the corresponding number of shorting caps to the left and
center two pins. If voltage input is selected, short the right and center pins of the corresponding
shorting cap. I and V are indicated on the board.

3.1 Software Selection
When the sensor is properly connected to the computer via USB to 485 and powered, the correct
COM port can be seen on the computer (“My Computer - Properties - Device Manager - Ports”
for COM ports).

Open the package, select“Debugging Software”---“485 Parameter Configuration Software”, find
the software and open it.
If you can't find the COM port in the device manager, it means you haven't installed the USB to
485 driver (in the package) or you haven't installed the driver correctly, please contact the
technician for help.

3.2 Parameter Configuration
1. After reaching the configuration interface, first of all, according to the method in chapter 3.1,
get the serial port number and select the correct serial port.
2. Click the test baud rate of the software, the software will test the baud rate and address of the
current device, the default baud rate is 4800bit/s, and the default address is 0x01.
The default baud rate is 4800bit/s, and the default address is 0x01.
3. Modify the address and baud rate according to your needs, and check the current functional
status of the device.
If the test is unsuccessful, please recheck the wiring of the device and the installation of the 485
driver.

4.2 Data Frame Format Definition
The ModBus-RTU communication protocol is used in the following format:
Initial structure ≥ 4 bytes of time
Address code = 1 byte
Function code = 1 byte
Data area = N bytes
Error check = 16 bit CRC code End structure ≥ 4 bytes of time
Address code: address of the transmitter, unique in the communication network (factory default
0x01), range 0x01-0xFE Function code: indication of the function of the command issued by the
host.
Data area: data area is specific communication data, note that 16bits data high byte in front!
CRC code: two-byte checksum code.
The host asks for the frame structure:

Description:
Returns the 1st channel data as 012CH, which converts to decimal 300, indicating that the current
analog acquisition data code value is 300.
Return the 2nd channel data is 0x00C8, converted to decimal 200, indicating that the current
analog acquisition data code value is 200.
If the module is 0-5V and the code value is 3000, the output signal is 5 * 3000/4095 = 3.66V.
If the module is 0-10V, the code value is 3000, the output signal is 10 * 3000/4095 = 7.33V.
If the module is 4-20mA and the code value is 3000, the output signal is 20 * 3000/4095 =
14.65mA.

The baud rate in the returned data is 0x01, indicating that the baud rate is 4800bps.

5.1 The Device Cannot Connect to the Computer
1. The computer has multiple COM ports and the port selected is incorrect.
2. The device address is wrong, or there are devices with duplicate addresses (factory default is 1 for
all).
3. The baud rate, parity, data bits, and stop bits are incorrect.
4. Host polling interval and wait for answer time are too short, need to be set above 200ms. 5. 485 bus
is disconnected.
5. The 485 bus is disconnected, or the A and B wires are reversed. 6.
6. The number of devices is too large or the wiring is too long, the power supply should be nearby, add
485 enhancer, and increase the 120Ω termination resistor.
7. USB to 485 driver is not installed or damaged.
8. The device is damaged.
